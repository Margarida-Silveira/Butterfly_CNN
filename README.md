CNNâ€™s for detection and measurement of butterfly eyespot patterns.

This repository contains the Python implementation for two CNN deep learning models.

1 - CNN model for eyespot and spot detection in butterfly images


For detection we use a YOLO model.

2- CNN model for the segmentation of eyespot images

For segmentation we use a U-NET model.
