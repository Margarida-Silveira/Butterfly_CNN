CNNâ€™s for detection and measurement of butterfly eyespot patterns.

This repository contains the Python implementation for two CNN deep learning models.

1 - CNN model for eyespot and spot detection in butterfly images

We use a YOLO model, adapted from https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3

2- CNN model for the segmentation of eyespot images

We use a U-NET model.
