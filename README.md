# CNNâ€™s for detection and measurement of butterfly eyespot patterns.

This repository contains the Python implementation for four CNN deep learning models:

* 1 - Three state-of-the-art CNN models for eyespot and spot detection in butterfly images;

* 2- A CNN model for the segmentation of eyespot images.

For detection we compare the performance of three models: ```YOLO, RetinaNet and EfficientDet```.
For segmentation we use a ```U-NET``` model.

## Overview

Overview of the two CNNs approach for first detecting and then measuring, spots or eyespots on images of butterfly wings.
